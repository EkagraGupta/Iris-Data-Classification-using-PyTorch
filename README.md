# Classifying Iris flower species using PyTorch with a beginner-friendly approach.

The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets for classification, making it a great starting point for anyone learning machine learning with PyTorch. This project builds a PyTorch-based classification model to accurately predict Iris flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

Using deep learning techniques, this tutorial walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference in a structured, beginner-friendly way. Whether you're new to PyTorch or looking for a hands-on classification project, this repository serves as a great learning resource.
